## Features

blobject-fit provides fallback support for images with `object-fit: cover` and `object-fit: contain` styles via `background-size: cover` and `background-size: contain` respectively.

blobject-fit is responsive-capable so long as the visitor's browser supports the particular markup you have chosen. For example:

```html
<img src="small.jpg" srcset="medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w" alt="Image" />
<!--
IE 11 will always use small.jpg, while Edge 14 will choose between small.jpg,
medium.jpg, and large.jpg depending on the screen size.
-->
```



## Requirements

blobject-fit does not require any Javascript frameworks, however browsers must support the following:
* [background-size](http://caniuse.com/#feat=background-img-opts)
* [classList](http://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist)
* [querySelector](http://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector) + [querySelectorAll](http://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector)

Responsive image sources (e.g. `srcset`, `<picture>`) require native browser support for the markup you've chosen. Otherwise it will just use the good ol' `src` source.



## Installation

### HTML

Download `blobject-fit.min.js`, add it to your project folder, and include it somewhere on the page.

```html
<script src="/path/to/blobject-fit.min.js"></script>
```

Or via Composer:
```bash
composer require "Blobfolio/blobject-fit:dev-master"
```

Or via Bower:
```bash
bower install blobject-fit
```

### CSS

Your existing `object-fit` CSS definitions may not be readable at runtime. Following the convention established by earlier `object-fit` polyfills, blobject-fit requires the inclusion of a clever `font-family` hack in your CSS:

```css
//an example using "cover"
.my-cover-image {
    object-fit: cover;
    font-family: 'object-fit: cover;';
}

//an example using "contain"
.my-contain-image {
    object-fit: contain;
    font-family: 'object-fit: contain;';
}
```

### Profit

That's it!

blobject-fit will automatically detect `object-fit` support when the DOM loads and, if necessary, adjust any fitted images it finds.
